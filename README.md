# VideoFilter
This repository contains an image and video filter framework for my APCS class.

Since it relies on processing.org's core.jar library macs may need to use JDK 8 and set their project to language level 8.
Even then it apparently sometimes only works on still images and not on a live webcam feed or an .mp4 file.

To the best of my knowledge on pc's it will work for still images, webcams, and .mp4 files.

Any help in improving mac combatibility is welcome.  I know processing 4.0 was recently released and this may help, but I haven't had time to test it yet.
